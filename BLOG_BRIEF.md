## Introduction

An important part of being a professional data scientist is being able to communicate clearly - both in writing and in person. Because of that, we will be asking you to write at five (5) blog posts before graduating. This short readme provides a little more information about why we ask you to blog, what we ask you to blog about, and how we'd like you to blog.

## Why To Blog

As a professional data scientist, you'll often have to communicate in writing. Sometimes you'll have to write something technical for your peers, at other times you'll have to provide a non-technical summary for business stakeholders. In either case, it's important to be able to distill a complex technical topic and share in writing the most important points.

A blog can also help you to *get* a data science job. It's a way to showcase your skills to potential employers before they decide to interview you, so it's important to realize that your blog posts may well be reviewed by potential employers when deciding whether or not to grant you an interview.

## How To Blog

As many of you have probably experienced, writing is hard. Not only is writing hard, but writing about data and technical concepts that you don’t know much about can be very challenging. Unfortunately, writing never seems to get much easier since one’s taste often exceeds one’s ability. In order to help you as you move towards writing about and sharing more technical documents, this readme will give you a structure of how to accomplish that.

In general, writing that is done quickly tends to be bad. In order to fix this problem, for blogs in Data Science at Flatiron, we ask that you pass a few checkpoints ahead of time so you are able to create a product that you are proud of.

The first checkpoint that will be required of all data science blogs is that you have your topic approved five days (including weekend days!) before your presentation. As instructors, we want to be able to do our best to support you in your writing and feel that opening up a dialogue about your topic sooner rather than later will alleviate stress for everyone involved. We also know that being data science students, it is hard to know what you don’t know. We are here to help guide you in your learning.

Once you have had your topic cleared, the next checkpoint you need is to send a minimal outline of your blog post two days before you are scheduled to present. For example, if your blog is scheduled to be presented on a Wednesday, you should have had your outline approved on Monday. Your minimal outline consists of:
    - Thesis statement: What will your reader go away knowing?
    - A plan of actionable topics to cover to accomplish your thesis
    - Three references to a prior source on the topic (papers, technical blogs, documentation, white papers, YouTube videos, stackoverflow posts)

In addition to speaking with an instructor about your minimal outline, you are also required to slack it to them. 

In thinking about a blog topic, it is important to define a general area of interest. Earlier blogs in many ways are going to be quite general because you are still learning, but in the second half of your time at Flatiron School, you should consider what you would like to specialize in. It is much better to write a blog that is short and sweet and the reader walks away knowing something, than a long, windy, garrulous post. A great source of inspiration is talking about first principles and being able to explain them clearly. One great example of a former FI student doing this is Mariam from the Software Engineering track. She wrote a series of posts (https://medium.com/@mariam.jaludi) on data structures and algorithms which clearly demonstrate her ability to communicate complex materials clearly. She now works at Amazon (causation!?).

From an insider perspective, writing blogs is very much about signaling that you are the person for the job. Anyone in technology would much rather work with someone who can communicate clearly and can then be taught more complex concepts rather than someone who presumably knows a lot but is difficult to communicate with. This is your chance to show that you are the former and not the latter.

## Blog Structure

Since writing is hard, below we offer a boilerplate template that you can follow in order to begin to structure your ideas. You do not have to follow it, but if you master this narrative then you will find that communicating ideas clearly will become much easier over time.

In general, we find the following structure of a blog post or even presentation very effective.

*Introduction*: What is the domain specific question?
*Data Science Operationalisation*: How and why can tools from data science help answer the question you initially asked?
*Data Science Analysis*: This is the part where you show off your new toy.
*Domain specific insight*: What insights do you now have access to now that you have completed your analysis? What does this matter?

Here are a few notes on each of the four structures.

The Introduction is your chance to get the reader’s attention. Why should the reader care? What is the pressing problem in one sentence. Is it a fact that will catch the reader’s eye? Do you have a juicy question? Can you promise a concise explanation to a difficult concept? In writing and in a presentation, you get to set the stage.

Once the stage is set and you have defined what question or topic you will be tackling and why it matters, your next job is to tell the listener why something that you know from the world of data science will give the answer here. Maybe it’s that huge datasets won’t fit in Excel? Maybe someone has developed an algorithm that solves the complex type of question you initially posed? Whatever it is, the solution that you provide should tee you up for what you are about to next show off.

Having now established a problem and a way to solve it, it’s now time to show off your skills. In the Analysis section you can include code, walk people through an analysis, or break down a complex idea. A mark of a great blog post (or any writing in general in this genre) is that the reader should leave the post feeling smarter having read what you wrote or what you said. Not only are you demonstrating that you are useful to have around (for your quant skills) but you also emit a positive energy that people want to have around because you make people feel good.

After your walk through, the last thing you want to do is wrap up what you did and why it matters. Like a scientific paper, feel free to restate what you attempted to solve here and how you did it. Gently pull the reader out of the technical bog and show them what we now know or can do given this new information. Don’t forget to remind them why it matters in a larger context.

Remember that the “point” of this blog is to show off your ability to convey technical information to a non-technical audience and why that matters. Through your writing, you want to be able to establish credibility as both an eloquent speaker, able of distilling complex information, as well as someone who is technically proficient in what you do. This of course is a big ask. But we are here to push you to be the best version of yourself that we can.

### Example

**Blog Topic**: How to Choose between Nested Models

*Introduction*: How do we know what model to choose?
There are tons of models in data science
Sometimes too many!
Without grounding in some theory, we run the risk of picking the wrong model and should rely on others to inform our choices?

**Operationalization**: In world of data science we have some ways to quantify
All common problems have way to explore this!
There are tons of ways of thinking about this, but going to focus on three here and talk about their advantages and drawbacks
Here going to do mean square error, bayesian information criterion, log likelihood comparison

**Analysis**: I will explain three model comparison metrics

**MSE**: Mean Square error. What is it? Why is it good, why is it bad?

**BIC**: Same as A

**Log Likelihood**: Same as A

**Insight**:
All problems are different and tools help us decide
Given what we learned we want to use BIC for xyz
Or might us MSE for xyz (but look out bc doesn’t obey statistical distribution!)
For that use Log Likelihood
Here is where I will be going for more info on this!
This allows us to make sure we pick the right model!!

Lastly, remember that your five blogs are a graduation requirement - without the five required blog posts, you won't be able to graduate from the program. Please feel free to write more posts, although in general a "reasonable quantity and great quality" is probably the best strategy so you can have 1-2 posts that you can point potential employers to that really show how you can write for both technical and non-technical audiences. The risk of too many posts is that employers will click onto some of the weaker ones if you didn't have the time to make them all great.
