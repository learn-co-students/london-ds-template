# Pandas Lectures

This directory contains lectures for working with pandas, the main library used in Python for indexing PANel DAta frameS.

The first lecture is a code along that allows student to still familiarize themselves with the Python langauge.
The second lecture gives students a chance to try out their knowledge in a more applied setting.
The third and fourth lectures are more supplemental and can be used to reinforce concepts.

The coach-code-along will be used the second week to let students hear a coach or lead thing through the process they would go through if they were analyzing a dataset.
